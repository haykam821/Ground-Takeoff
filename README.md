Allows firework boosting with an elytra while on the ground.

Ground Takeoff requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Ground Takeoff from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ground-takeoff/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Ground-Takeoff/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

Rather than requiring the user to jump twice to enter the elytra fall-flying state, this mod allows directly right-clicking with a firework in order for a player to launch themselves.
